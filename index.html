        <h2>Meet Trent Mulder</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to becoming a real estate agent, Trent was born and raised in
          Ontario, CA. He has spent most of his life living in Southern
          California and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Physics at Point
          Loma Nazarene University, located in San Diego, CA. Before becoming a
          real estate agent, he has worked as a Manufacturing Engineer at
          Vertechs Enterprises, General Atomics, and Northrop Grumman.<br />
          <br />
          His interpersonal and analytical skills that were acquired from his
          time as a Principal Manufacturing Engineer, has led to his interests
          in immersing himself into the real estate world. Trent's work ethic
          and deep commitment towards helping others has proven to give him
          leverage over others in the industry.
          <br />
          <br />
          When he is not working on real estate, Trent can be found running,
          weightlifting, surfing or fixing cars. He also enjoys going on cruises
          and spending time at the beach. With both his analytical skills as an
          engineer and his love for prime real estate, he is committed to giving
          his clients the best options possible.
